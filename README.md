## The Story Behind It

> I was scrolling through Instagram and saw a login animation that didn’t just *work*, it *felt* like something.  
> It made me realize: most login pages are just forms. But what if the login was the *first impression* of your brand?  
> What if it was an **experience** from the very first pixel?
> 
> So I paused the reel and started building the next day!

I’m still learning, but I’m excited.  
And I can’t wait to build more things that *move people*.
